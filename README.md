![screenshot](https://pbs.twimg.com/media/CI8UO0RXAAApEX9.png:medium)

This repository is for for using the Microsoft Kinect sensor with [Processing](http://processing.org).  It uses the open source drivers from the [libfreenect](https://github.com/OpenKinect/libfreenect) and [libfreenect2](https://github.com/OpenKinect/libfreenect2) projects.

### Some important notes:
* Kinect v2 support is working (Thanks to @ThomasLengeling!!) but very much in progress. To do: [align APIs](https://github.com/shiffman/OpenKinect-for-Processing/issues/20), [make examples](https://github.com/shiffman/OpenKinect-for-Processing/issues/19), and [remove separate install for libturbojpeg](https://github.com/shiffman/OpenKinect-for-Processing/issues/12)
* This is current Mac OS X only! [I'd like this to change](https://github.com/shiffman/OpenKinect-for-Processing/issues/13).
* This new version is yet to be updated for the Processing contributions manager.  [Download here](https://github.com/shiffman/OpenKinect-for-Processing/releases).
